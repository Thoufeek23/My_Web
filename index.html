            <a href="https://github.com/Thoufeek23/Search_Engine" style="text-decoration:none" ><h3>Search Engine</h3>
            <p>Developed a celebrity search engine in C++ that allows users to efficiently find and manage celebrity data based on name, age, field, and popularity by integrating multiple data structures. 
                A Max Heap enables constant-time retrieval of the most popular celebrity, while a Binary Search Tree (BST) supports quick name-based searches. An array-based list (similar to a Hashtable) stores 
                and displays all celebrities, and a stack maintains a history of previously visited profiles for instant backtracking. The project follows a modular structure with separate .h and .cpp files, compiled 
                and linked using a Makefile for efficient execution. This implementation demonstrates my proficiency in C++ data structures, algorithm design, and performance optimization.</p></a>

            <a href="https://github.com/Thoufeek23/Personal_Finance_Tracker" style="text-decoration:none" ><h3>Personal Finance Tracker</h3>
            <p>Developed a full-stack web application using Flask and SQLAlchemy, enabling users to securely manage and track
                personal expenses, with dynamic category-wise spending breakdowns. Implemented user authentication with Flask-Login, and created interactive data visualizations using Matplotlib to generate
                real-time spending reports. Designed a responsive UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a seamless experience for logging expenses, viewing
                totals, and managing financial records.</p></a>

        <div class="project-card">
            <a href="https://github.com/Thoufeek23/Relationship_Finder" style="text-decoration:none" ><h3>Relationship Finder</h3>
            <p>Developed a Python-based software designed to determine the relationship between any two individuals within a given
                family tree. Used the concept of weighted graphs in data structures to build a family. Implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the minimum distance between two nodes, The shortest path identified
                between two nodes represents the minimal relational distance, which is used to determine the specific relationship between
                the individuals</p></a>

            <p>Created a responsive, completely functional multi-page website for a Brownie Store, improving the user interface and
                overall user experience. Used HTML and CSS to develop the webpage, adding features like color schemes, seamless transitions. Javascript was used to implement traversal between pages, such as the product listings, shopping cart, and checkout
                sections, with ease
